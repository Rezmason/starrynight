Notes on the original screensavers

ordinary stars
	Position
		Their x position is purely random
		On a 512 x 342 screen, their y position is quadratically eased in (1 - sqrt(random))
	0.215 stars are added per frame
	0.0126 random stars are removed per frame per one star present
	star colors can be any RGB combination
		In 256 color mode, they are random colors from the Mac OS color palette
shooting stars
	bright red
	They are "comet shaped"
		Probably a sprite sheet
		3 pixel radius
	They always fall left/right and down
		Slope of 14 x to 10 y
		Random start position
		On a 512x342 screen, they always start at the top
			On larger screens, this doesn't seem to be the case
	They occur randomly
		Seems like the delay between any two shooting stars is eased in but never more than 3.5 seconds
			min(floor(1 - pow(random(), 0.2) * 5000), 3500)
		Only one at a time
		They last 18 frames
buildings
	At first, this was only in Starry Skylines
	Flasher on tallest
	Black silhouette with windows drawn on top
	Older versions: all windows are same color
		What color is that?
		Building height based on a percent-of-the-screen, plus a random offset
		Buildings can overlap; the building in the front occludes the one in the back
		Random x position
		Random floor height, window x offset, and floor padding
		windows were single pixels, winking on and off like the stars
	Newer versions dim the background buildings
		What colors are their windows?
			256 color mode: #FFFF00
			Old: #FCF305
			Shades of yellow depending on background color
		Windows can now be multiple pixels tall
		Buildings can be circular or triangular too, but no thanks
