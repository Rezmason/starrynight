Starry night

Observations

	Buildings
		Random width (in rooms)
		Random height (in floors)
		Random floor height and gap
		Random window width and gap
		"Background" buildings are shorter, thinner, dimmer yellow, and have smaller windows
			It might be that they're built from smaller room layouts
		Tallest one gets aircraft warning light (aka "Flasher")
			Blinks red on and off, since beginning of screensaver
		I am not doing the circular buildings, they are bullshit

	Star spawning
		Random positions, more up top than at the bottom
		Seem to be random colors
		Obstructed by buildings

	Window lighting
		Randomly appear, less frequently randomly disappear
		Closer buildings block farther away buildings

	Meteor
		is a fast, infrequent animation
		A line segment moving along its line, at a shallow angle (13/9)
		Blocked by buildings

Research
- What were all its versions like?

- Who made it and why?

- What's its source code like?

	Note: https://www.bryanbraun.com/after-dark-css/ doesn't include starry night
		Probably hard to achieve in pure CSS!

Analyze screenshots and video capture for statistical info
	Count the stars in the sky
	What are all the colors of all the stars?
	What is every type of building?
	Are the stars visible through the buildings?
	Are buildings visible through other buildings?
	How many building layers are there?
	What do the meteors look like?

What makes a starry night?
	No moon
	Clear sky
	Enough stars to detect the dark ground below

Understanding the skyline
	Slowly lights up at night
		These buildings can't all be residential

What makes starry night nostalgic?
	The simplicity
	A city skyline slowly lighting up
	The characteristics of CRT

What makes sky photography beautiful?
	Circles around Polaris
	Dusk
	Silhouetted landscape
	Milky Way?

Brainstorming
	Random stars
		Reuse star color picker from starfield project
	Familiar stars
		Use actual data from someplace?

	Rotate sky very very slowly
		Move one star at a time
	Buildings, trees, hills, mountains?
	Hint of Milky Way?
	Choice of city would be interesting
		People could submit cities
		Building templates
	Build skyline in "3D" and rotate it at an imperceptibly slow speed
		Parallax
	Water reflection?
	Kenmore Square CITGO sign easter egg?

	Hillside (silhouette, with aircraft warning light on peak)
	Morse secret in skyline
	Morse secret in sky

	Give buildings front and side
		Project from city grid, viewed from the side

	Curtain Wall buildings
		Curtain wall buildings have larger windows and smaller gaps
		Curtain wall buildings' floors are typically all lit or all not lit, all night
	Masonry buildings
		larger gaps

	Residential highrise
		3-5 identical background buildings of either above type
		But windows are individually lit, maybe different colors
			Large % of windows go out as night progresses

Technique
	Multiple canvases, with "glow" canvases on top
		Individual control of resolution, position and glow
		Sky
			Dusk?
			Stars
			Meteors
		Each Building
			Silhouette
			Lights
			Light glow
			Underlit slightly by streetlights?
	Randomization of buildings
		Represent all the buildings someplace
	Faithful reproduction?
		Triangular and circular buildings
		Random color stars
		Not really into it actually
	Choice of resolution
		Add fractional resolution options on retina displays
