#TODO

- Copy-paste stuff from Matrix project (or a regl sample project)
- Strategy
	- All blurring and glowing will be done in a bloom post process
	- Everything I'm drawing is a color quad
		- Except the meteor, which is a textured, tinted quad
	- Animate the meteor last
	- Stars: a mesh containing the max number of stars, that you only draw some of
		- To add a star: assign its position and color to an already existing mesh
		- To remove a star: swap it with the last one and draw to a lower index
	- Buildings
		- Observation: Every window and silhouette *already exists*
		- Idea 1: Create building mesh of opaque z-sorted rectangles and colors
			- To light up or dim a window: set its state to "on" or "off"
		- Idea 2: Create building mesh of isometric objects
			- This would actually work the exact same
			- Silhouettes would be an "X" of two interior opaque quads
			- Windows would wrap around them
- rotate the stars around the earth's axis?
	- add a 2D transform matrix
- rotate the buildings as an isometric 3D thing?
	- 3D building geometry is a must
	- Add a 3D transform matrix
